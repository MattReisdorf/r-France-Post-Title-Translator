# r-France-Post-Title-Translator

Simple python script to translate non-English posts on Reddit. Defaults to r/France because I'm trying to keep my literacy, but works for any non-English sub. 

Utilizes PRAW, so a dev account on reddit is needed, and a non-affiliated version of Google Translate API. 

You can change the desired subreddit in line 33. For example, changing "France" to "de" will translate post titles in the main German-speaking subreddit. 

sub.new in line 36 can be changed to sub.("hot", "rising", "controversial", or "top") for different posts.
